# Problem

## Problem
We need to use themed-markdown in a React Native (Expo) mobile application to render markdown content fetched from GitHub. Currently, themed-markdown only supports web (React DOM) environments.

## Current Blockers
1. The package has `react-dom` as a peer dependency (package.json line 72)
2. All components use web-based React (react-markdown, react-zoom-pan-pinch, etc.)
3. Build target is set to "browser" (package.json line 21)
4. Uses web-only dependencies like lucide-react, @uiw/react-textarea-code-editor

## What We Need
A React Native compatible version of themed-markdown that:

1. **Exports React Native components** instead of/in addition to web components
   - Replace or provide RN alternatives for DocumentView component
   - Replace react-markdown with react-native-markdown-display or similar
   - Handle platform-specific rendering (web vs native)

2. **Platform-specific exports** in package.json:
   ```json
   "react-native": "dist/index.native.js",
   "main": "dist/index.js"
   ```

3. **Remove/abstract web-only dependencies**:
   - react-dom → React Native primitives (View, Text, ScrollView, etc.)
   - lucide-react → react-native-svg icons or @expo/vector-icons
   - Mermaid diagrams → Consider react-native-svg for mobile rendering
   - HTML modals → React Native Modal component

4. **Key features needed in RN version**:
   - Basic markdown rendering (headings, bold, italic, lists, code blocks)
   - Theme support (already using @a24z/industry-theme which we have)
   - Syntax highlighting for code blocks
   - GitHub Flavored Markdown support

## Use Case
Mobile app for browsing GitHub repositories and rendering markdown files with beautiful themed styling, similar to the web version but optimized for mobile devices.

## Current Workaround
Using react-native-markdown-display as a temporary solution, but we want the consistent themed-markdown styling across web and mobile platforms.

## Package Info
- Current version: 0.1.62
- Repository: https://github.com/a24z-ai/themed-markdown
- Already discussed with team about RN support
